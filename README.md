### ü§î What is Kamaji?

[Kamaji](http://github.com/clastix/kamaji) is an Open-Source project offering hosted Kubernetes control planes.
tl;dr; the Control Plane is running in a management cluster as regular pods.

You can refer to the [official documentation website](https://kamaji.clastix.io/).

### üìÑ Documentation

The Kamaji Cluster API Control Plane provider documentation is referenced in the [Kamaji documentation](https://kamaji.clastix.io/) website.

### üõ† Development

This document describes how to use kind and [Tilt](https://tilt.dev/) for a simplified workflow that offers easy deployments and rapid iterative builds.
Before the next steps, make sure the initial setup for development environment steps is complete.

1. Create a `kind` cluster according to the [CAPI Infrastructure Provider requirements](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/user/quick-start#install-andor-configure-a-kubernetes-cluster) you're planning to use
2. [Install Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/user/quick-start#initialize-the-management-cluster) with the `clusterctl` CLI
3. Install Kamaji (for the sake of simplicity, we suggest [Helm](https://github.com/clastix/kamaji/tree/master/charts/kamaji#install-kamaji))
4. Get the source of the Kamaji Control Plane provider and place in your desired `LOCATION`
5. Run the _Kamaji Cluster API Control Plane Provider_ as you prefer, as well as with `dlv` to debug it 
6. Run Tilt by issuing `tilt up`
7. You have a full development environment

### üè∑Ô∏è Versioning

Versioning adheres to the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) principles.
A full list of the available release is available in the GitHub repository's [**Release** section](https://github.com/clastix/cluster-api-control-plane-provider-kamaji/releases).

### üìÑ Compatibility matrix

The Control Plane provider has several dependencies, such as Cluster API and Kamaji.

The following compatibility matrix is useful to match them according to the Control Plane provider version you're planning to run.
